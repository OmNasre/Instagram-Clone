## Introduction:
The Instagram Clone project is built using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. It replicates core functionalities of Instagram, such as user registration, post 
management, likes, comments, and an admin panel for user and post management. The key feature of this application is a responsive and minimalist design that mimics Instagramâ€™s user experience.

# Key Features:
# User Registration and Login:

Users can register and log in using their credentials. The application supports role-based authentication where Admins are redirected to an admin dashboard, while Regular Users are redirected to the posts page.
The session management ensures users stay logged in, with sessions holding user information.
